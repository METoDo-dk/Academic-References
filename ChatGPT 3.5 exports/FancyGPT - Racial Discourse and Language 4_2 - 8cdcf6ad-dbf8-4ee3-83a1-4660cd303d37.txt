Introduction:

In recent years, the topic of racial discourse and language has gained significant attention in both academic and public spheres. The power of language to shape our perceptions of race and ethnicity cannot be understated, and as such, it has been the focus of numerous studies across various disciplines. This literature review will provide an overview of the current state of research on racial discourse and language, highlighting key findings and themes that have emerged in the field.

Language and Power:

One of the central themes in the literature on racial discourse and language is the relationship between language and power. Scholars have demonstrated that language can be used as a tool to perpetuate racial inequalities and maintain power imbalances between different racial groups (Bonilla-Silva, 2019; Collins, 2006). For instance, studies have shown that certain linguistic practices, such as the use of racial slurs or code-switching, can reinforce racial hierarchies and reinforce stereotypes about particular racial groups (Hill, 2008; Smitherman, 2000).

Language and Identity:

Another key theme in the literature on racial discourse and language is the relationship between language and identity. Research has shown that language can play a significant role in shaping how individuals understand and construct their racial identities (Alim, 2016; Norton, 2010). For instance, studies have shown that individuals may use language as a way to signal their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, or to assert their racial identity in situations where it is under threat (Bucholtz & Hall, 2004; Harris-Perry, 2011).

Language and Discrimination:

The literature on racial discourse and language has also focused on the role that language can play in perpetuating discrimination against individuals from marginalized racial groups. Research has shown that language can be used to discriminate against individuals in a variety of contexts, including employment, education, and healthcare (Gee, 2015; Jones, 2017). For instance, studies have shown that individuals who speak with non-standard dialects or accents may be subject to discrimination and bias in the workplace or in educational settings (Labov, 2010; Rickford, 2013).

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the literature on racial discourse and language has shed light on the complex ways in which language can shape our perceptions of race and ethnicity. By highlighting the relationships between language and power, identity, and discrimination, scholars have provided valuable insights into the ways in which language can be used to perpetuate racial inequalities and marginalize individuals from marginalized racial groups. As such, future research in this field should continue to explore these themes in greater depth, in order to better understand the role that language plays in shaping our understanding of race and ethnicity.
