Introduction:

Cell-free systems are becoming increasingly popular in the field of synthetic biology as a means of constructing complex biological systems. The use of cell-free systems offers many advantages over traditional in vivo approaches, including reduced complexity, increased control, and improved scalability. This literature review will provide an overview of the current state of research on cell-free systems, including the different types of systems that are available, their applications, and the challenges that still need to be addressed.

Types of Cell-Free Systems:

There are two main types of cell-free systems: lysate-based systems and purified component-based systems. Lysate-based systems are created by breaking open cells and using the resulting cellular extract as the basis for the cell-free system. Purified component-based systems, on the other hand, use purified enzymes and other components to create a synthetic biological system.

Applications of Cell-Free Systems:

Cell-free systems have a wide range of potential applications, including the production of therapeutic proteins, the construction of biosensors, and the creation of synthetic genetic circuits. One particularly promising application is the use of cell-free systems for the production of complex biologics. Recent studies have shown that cell-free systems can be used to produce proteins that are difficult or impossible to produce using traditional in vivo approaches.

Challenges:

Despite the many advantages of cell-free systems, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. One major challenge is the limited lifespan of cell-free systems, which can limit the scalability of the technology. Another challenge is the need for improved control over the cellular environment within the cell-free system. Current approaches rely on simple buffer systems, which may not provide the necessary level of control for more complex biological systems.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, cell-free systems offer many advantages over traditional in vivo approaches for constructing complex biological systems. However, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed before cell-free systems can be widely adopted as a standard approach in synthetic biology. Future research will need to focus on improving the lifespan and scalability of cell-free systems, as well as developing better methods for controlling the cellular environment within the system.
