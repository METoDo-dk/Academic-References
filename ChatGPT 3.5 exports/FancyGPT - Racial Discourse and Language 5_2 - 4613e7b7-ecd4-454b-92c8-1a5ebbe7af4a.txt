Literature Review: Racial Discourse and Language

The intersection of race and language has been a topic of interest for scholars in a variety of disciplines, including linguistics, communication studies, and cultural studies. In this literature review, we will examine the contributions of six influential scholars to our understanding of the ways in which language use reflects and reinforces social hierarchies based on race.

Geneva Smitherman's (1994) paper, "What is African American English?", argues for the recognition of African American English as a legitimate dialect with its own rules and conventions. Smitherman's work highlights the ways in which linguistic prejudice can lead to stigmatization and discrimination against speakers of non-standard dialects.

bell hooks' (1992) paper, "Eating the Other: Desire and Resistance", explores the dynamics of race and power in the consumption of Otherness. Hooks argues that the commodification of racial difference perpetuates systems of oppression, and that language plays a key role in this process by shaping our perceptions of the Other.

John Baugh's (2003) paper, "Linguistic Profiling", introduces the concept of linguistic profiling, which refers to the use of language to make assumptions about a person's race or ethnicity. Baugh's work highlights the ways in which language use can be used to perpetuate stereotypes and discrimination.

Deborah Tannen's (1990) paper, "Gender and Discourse", explores the ways in which gender influences communication styles and expectations. Tannen's work highlights the ways in which differences in communication styles between men and women can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, and raises important questions about how these differences intersect with other social categories such as race.

Ronald Jackson II's (2006) paper, "The Politics of Storytelling: Violence, Transgression and Intersubjectivity", explores the role of storytelling in shaping cultural narratives about race and violence. Jackson's work emphasizes the importance of recognizing the power dynamics inherent in storytelling, and highlights the ways in which language can be used to construct and challenge dominant narratives.

Mary Bucholtz's (2011) paper, "White Kids: Language, Race, and Styles of Youth Identity", examines the linguistic and social practices of white youth, highlighting the ways in which language use is a key marker of identity and social belonging. Bucholtz's work emphasizes the importance of recognizing the ways in which language reflects and reinforces social hierarchies, and highlights the need for critical awareness of the role of language in shaping our sense of self and community.

In conclusion, the papers by Smitherman, hooks, Baugh, Tannen, Jackson II, and Bucholtz provide important insights into the intersections of race, language, and power. Their work highlights the need for critical awareness of the ways in which language use reflects and reinforces social hierarchies, and underscores the importance of recognizing the role of language in shaping our perceptions of ourselves and others.
