Review of Literature:

Solove (2006) presents a seminal work in the field of privacy rights.

Allen's work sheds light on the social dimensions of privacy and contributes to the ongoing debate on privacy rights in diverse contexts.

Nissenbaum's (2004) influential paper, "Privacy as Contextual Integrity," introduces the theory of contextual integrity.
