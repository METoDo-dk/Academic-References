Cohen, and Jennifer Stisa Granick will be analyzed to explore different perspectives and concepts related to privacy and surveillance.

Alan F. Westin's seminal work, "Privacy and Freedom" (1967), laid the foundation for contemporary discussions on privacy. Westin's exploration of privacy in the modern age and its relationship to personal freedom and autonomy continues to influence scholars and policymakers today. His book presents a comprehensive analysis of privacy rights and the challenges posed by emerging technologies.

Helen Nissenbaum's paper, "Privacy as Contextual Integrity" (2004), has significantly contributed to our understanding of privacy in the context of social norms and information flows.

(2011), delves into the concept of "unpopular privacy" and highlights the significance of protecting privacy interests that may not align with widely accepted norms.
