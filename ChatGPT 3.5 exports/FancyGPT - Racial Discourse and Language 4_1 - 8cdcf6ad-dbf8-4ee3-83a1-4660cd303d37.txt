Introduction:

Racial discourse and language have been the focus of academic inquiry for many decades, and the literature on this topic is vast and multifaceted. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the research on racial discourse and language. In this review, I will discuss the different approaches and theories that have been used to study this topic and highlight some of the key findings and debates in the literature.

Approaches to Studying Racial Discourse and Language:

One of the most common approaches to studying racial discourse and language is through the analysis of media representations. This approach is based on the assumption that the media plays a significant role in shaping public perceptions of race and ethnicity. Several studies have examined how racial minorities are portrayed in the media and have found that they are often represented in stereotypical and negative ways (Entman, 1992; Dixon & Linz, 2000).

Another approach to studying racial discourse and language is through the analysis of everyday conversation. This approach is based on the assumption that language use reflects and reproduces social structures and relations. Several studies have examined how race is talked about in everyday conversation and have found that racial discourse is often marked by ambiguity, avoidance, and discomfort (Bonilla-Silva, 2010; Ford & Ferguson, 2004).

A third approach to studying racial discourse and language is through the analysis of political discourse. This approach is based on the assumption that political leaders play a significant role in shaping public attitudes towards race and ethnicity. Several studies have examined how political leaders talk about race and ethnicity and have found that they often use coded language and dog-whistle politics to appeal to their base (Kalla & Broockman, 2020; Mendelberg, 2001).

Key Findings and Debates:

One of the key findings in the literature on racial discourse and language is that language use reflects and reinforces social hierarchies and power relations. Several studies have shown that linguistic practices such as code-switching and linguistic appropriation can be used as strategies for asserting dominance and maintaining social boundaries (Heller, 2011; Mendoza-Denton, 2008).

Another key finding in the literature is that racial discourse is often marked by ambiguity and avoidance. Several studies have shown that people are often hesitant to talk about race and that discussions about race can be uncomfortable and difficult to navigate (Ford & Ferguson, 2004; Tatum, 1997).

A debate in the literature on racial discourse and language is whether language can be used to challenge and disrupt existing power relations. Some scholars argue that language can be a tool for resistance and social change, while others argue that language is inherently shaped by power and cannot be used to challenge it (Hill, 2008; Spivak, 1988).

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the literature on racial discourse and language is vast and multifaceted. Approaches to studying this topic include the analysis of media representations, everyday conversation, and political discourse. Key findings in the literature include the role of language in reinforcing social hierarchies and the prevalence of ambiguity and avoidance in discussions about race. Debates in the literature include whether language can be used to challenge existing power relations. Further research is needed to better understand the complex relationship between language and race and to develop strategies for promoting more inclusive and equitable language practices.
