Literature Review

Racial discourse and language have been topics of great interest in the fields of rhetoric and communication studies. Scholars have explored the ways in which language is used to construct and perpetuate racial hierarchies, as well as the ways in which language can be used to resist and subvert these hierarchies. In this review, we will examine some of the seminal works on this topic, including papers by bell hooks, Geneva Smitherman, Gloria Anzaldúa, Ronald Jackson II, Sara Ahmed, and John Rickford.

In her highly cited paper "Eating the Other: Desire and Resistance," bell hooks examines the ways in which dominant cultures consume and commodify the cultures of marginalized groups. She argues that this process of consumption reinforces the power dynamics of racial hierarchies and perpetuates the objectification of marginalized groups. Hooks' paper highlights the importance of understanding the ways in which language is used to reinforce these power dynamics.

Geneva Smitherman's classic work "Talkin and Testifyin: The Language of Black America" explores the unique features of African American English (AAE) and the ways in which it has been stigmatized in American society. Smitherman argues that AAE is a legitimate language variety with its own rules and conventions, and that stigmatizing it perpetuates racial discrimination and oppression. Smitherman's paper is an important contribution to the field of linguistics and highlights the importance of recognizing the cultural and linguistic diversity of marginalized groups.

Gloria Anzaldúa's "Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza" is a groundbreaking work that explores the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and language. Anzaldúa argues that borderlands - the spaces between cultures and identities - are sites of resistance and transformation. She calls for a new mestiza consciousness that embraces multiple identities and cultures and challenges the rigid categories imposed by dominant culture. Anzaldúa's paper highlights the importance of recognizing the fluidity of identity and the ways in which language is used to construct and maintain power dynamics.

Ronald Jackson II's "Scripting the Black Masculine Body: Identity, Discourse, and Racial Politics in Popular Media" examines the ways in which Black masculinity is constructed and represented in popular media. He argues that media representations of Black masculinity reinforce racial stereotypes and perpetuate systemic racism. Jackson's paper highlights the importance of examining the ways in which language and visual media are used to perpetuate racial hierarchies and the importance of resisting these representations.

Sara Ahmed's "Affective Economies" explores the ways in which emotions are used to create and maintain social hierarchies. She argues that emotions are not purely individual experiences but are shaped by social norms and power dynamics. Ahmed's paper highlights the importance of understanding the ways in which emotions are used to reinforce racial hierarchies and perpetuate systemic racism.

John Rickford's "Stylistic Variation and Change in African American English" examines the ways in which AAE has evolved over time and the ways in which it is used in different contexts. He argues that AAE is a dynamic and constantly evolving language variety that reflects the experiences and cultural practices of African Americans. Rickford's paper highlights the importance of recognizing the diversity and complexity of AAE and the ways in which language is shaped by social and cultural contexts.

Conclusion

The papers reviewed in this literature review highlight the importance of understanding the ways in which language is used to construct and perpetuate racial hierarchies, as well as the ways in which language can be used to resist and subvert these hierarchies.
