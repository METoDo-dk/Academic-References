Literature Review: Racial Discourse and Language

The intersection of race and language has been a topic of interest to scholars across a range of disciplines, including rhetoric. In particular, the work of Geneva Smitherman has been instrumental in developing our understanding of African American Language (AAL) and African American English (AAE). Smitherman's 1977 book, "Talkin and Testifyin: The Language of Black America," remains a seminal text in this field, providing a framework for analyzing the unique features of AAL and its use in everyday communication.

Another influential scholar in this area is Gloria Anzaldúa, whose 1987 essay "Towards a New Consciousness" explores the intersection of language, identity, and power for Chicana women. Anzaldúa's work is notable for its emphasis on the ways in which language can be used to resist dominant power structures and construct new forms of identity.

Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's 1972 article "The Language of African Literature" is also highly relevant to the study of racial discourse and language. Thiong'o argues that the use of English in African literature is inherently political, as it perpetuates the legacy of colonialism and marginalizes local languages. Thiong'o's work has been influential in the field of postcolonial studies and has contributed to ongoing debates about the politics of language.

bell hooks' 1981 essay "Ain't I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism" is another important contribution to the study of racial discourse and language. In this essay, hooks argues that the experiences of black women are often erased or marginalized in mainstream feminist discourse, and that language plays a key role in this process. Hooks' work has been highly influential in the development of intersectional feminist theory.

Sara Ahmed's 2004 article "Affective Economies" is relevant to the study of racial discourse and language for its exploration of the ways in which affect and emotion shape our interactions with language. Ahmed argues that affective economies operate at the level of language, influencing our use of words and shaping our experiences of communication.

Finally, Angela Davis' 1981 essay "Racism, Birth Control and Reproductive Rights" is relevant to the study of racial discourse and language for its examination of the intersection of race, gender, and language in the context of social justice movements. Davis argues that the language of the reproductive rights movement has often been framed in ways that marginalize the experiences of women of color, and that a more intersectional approach is necessary.

In conclusion, the literature on racial discourse and language is diverse and multidisciplinary, with contributions from scholars across a range of fields. The papers discussed in this review are just a few examples of the important work being done in this area, and highlight the ongoing importance of studying the intersections of race and language in our society.
