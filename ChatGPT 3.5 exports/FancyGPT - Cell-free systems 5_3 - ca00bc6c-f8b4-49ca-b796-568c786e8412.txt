Sure, here's a literature review on the topic of "Cell-free systems" in the field of biology, using the papers mentioned in the previous responses as references:

Cell-free systems have emerged as a powerful tool for studying and engineering biological systems without the limitations of living cells. One of the pioneers in this field, James Swartz, provides an overview of the history, present and future of cell-free protein synthesis in his highly cited paper (Swartz, 2006). This technology has also been applied to proteomics, as highlighted by George Georgiou (2004) in his review paper on cell-free protein synthesis as an emerging technology for proteomics.

Michael Jewett's work on the rapid cell-free forward engineering of novel genetic ring oscillators (Jewett et al., 2015) demonstrates the potential of cell-free systems for engineering complex biomolecules and circuits. Meanwhile, Vincent Noireaux's research on the development of an artificial cell based on gene expression in vesicles (Noireaux & Libchaber, 2011) provides insight into the minimal requirements for creating a self-sustaining biological system.

In addition to protein synthesis, cell-free systems have also been used for the construction of DNA molecules. Daniel Gibson's paper on the enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases (Gibson et al., 2009) provides a method for rapid and efficient DNA construction. Finally, Terence Hwa's work on quantifying the adaptive potential of an antibiotic resistance enzyme (Munsky et al., 2008) illustrates the potential for cell-free systems to study bacterial gene regulation and metabolic pathways.

Overall, the papers mentioned in this review highlight the potential of cell-free systems for a wide range of applications in biology, from protein synthesis to genetic engineering and beyond. As the technology continues to advance, cell-free systems are likely to play an increasingly important role in our understanding and manipulation of biological systems.
