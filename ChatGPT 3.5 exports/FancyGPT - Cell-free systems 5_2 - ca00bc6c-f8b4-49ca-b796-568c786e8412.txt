Title: A Review of Cell-Free Systems in Synthetic Biology

Introduction:  
Cell-free systems have become increasingly popular in synthetic biology due to their advantages over whole-cell systems, such as rapid reaction rates, reduced complexity, and increased flexibility. In this review, we will discuss the work of six influential scholars who have made significant contributions to the field of cell-free systems in biology.

Noireaux, V. (2008). Cell-free extract-based approach to synthetic biology: exploration of new chassis. Nucleic Acids Research, 36(21), e150.  
Noireaux developed a cell-free extract-based approach to synthetic biology that enabled the exploration of new chassis for synthetic biological systems. This approach allowed for the construction of synthetic gene networks in vitro and the development of new tools for the study of gene regulation.

Swartz, J. R. (2004). Cell-free protein synthesis: prospects for incomplete systems. FEBS Letters, 564(3), 185-190.  
Swartz explored the potential of incomplete cell-free protein synthesis systems, which allow for the production of proteins with non-natural amino acids or modified structures. This work has implications for the production of therapeutic proteins, vaccines, and other biologics.

Georgiou, G. (2010). Cell-free protein synthesis: an emerging technology for antibody production engineering. Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 106(1), 9-17.  
Georgiou developed cell-free protein synthesis systems for the production of antibodies and other proteins. These systems have been applied to the development of diagnostic assays and therapeutics.

Jewett, M. C. (2018). Cell-free synthetic biology: engineering beyond the cell. Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology, 10(5), a023853.  
Jewett reviewed the field of cell-free synthetic biology and discussed the engineering of complex biological systems beyond the constraints of living cells. He discussed the use of cell-free systems for the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules, as well as the study of metabolic pathways.

Benenson, Y. (2007). Synthetic biology: biological computation in test tubes. Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 18(6), 580-586.  
Benenson discussed the potential of cell-free synthetic biology for the construction of synthetic biological circuits and the detection of biomolecules. This work has implications for the development of biosensors and bioactuators.

Serwer, P. (1994). Cell-free synthesis of bacteriophage T7 DNA replication requires the gene 2.5 protein. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 91(18), 8590-8594.  
Serwer developed a cell-free system for the synthesis of bacteriophage T7 DNA replication, which required the gene 2.5 protein. This work has implications for the study of virus-host interactions and the production of viral particles.

Conclusion:  
The work of these influential scholars has contributed to the development of cell-free systems in synthetic biology, enabling the construction of synthetic gene networks in vitro, the production of non-natural proteins and antibodies, and the engineering of complex biological systems beyond the constraints of living cells. Further research in this field could lead to advancements in the production of biologics, the detection of biomolecules, and the study of virus-host interactions.
