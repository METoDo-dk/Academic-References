Introduction:

Cell-free systems have emerged as an important tool for studying biological processes without the need for intact cells. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in cell-free systems due to their versatility and ease of use. This literature review aims to summarize and critically evaluate recent research on cell-free systems and their applications.

Background:

Cell-free systems are prepared by extracting cellular components, such as enzymes, ribosomes, and other proteins, from cells and using them to reconstitute biological processes in vitro. These systems can be used to study a wide range of biological processes, including transcription, translation, and metabolism. One of the major advantages of cell-free systems is their flexibility and ease of use, as they can be easily modified and optimized for different applications.

Recent Research:

In recent years, cell-free systems have been used for a variety of applications, including protein synthesis, drug discovery, and synthetic biology. For example, a recent study by Garamella et al. (2021) demonstrated the use of cell-free systems for the production of complex proteins, including antibodies and enzymes. The authors used a cell-free system based on E. coli lysate and optimized it for the efficient synthesis of proteins with multiple disulfide bonds.

In another recent study, Caschera et al. (2020) used a cell-free system to develop a biosensor for detecting the presence of heavy metals in the environment. The biosensor was based on a cell-free system containing DNA, RNA, and ribosomes, and was able to detect the presence of mercury ions with high sensitivity and specificity.

In addition to their applications in protein synthesis and biosensing, cell-free systems have also been used for synthetic biology applications, such as the development of artificial cells. A recent study by Hwang et al. (2020) demonstrated the use of a cell-free system for the construction of artificial cells capable of performing complex biochemical reactions, such as gene expression and signal transduction.

Conclusion:

Cell-free systems have emerged as a powerful tool for studying biological processes and developing new applications in protein synthesis, biosensing, and synthetic biology. Recent research has demonstrated the versatility and potential of cell-free systems, and future studies are likely to explore new applications and optimize existing systems for increased efficiency and functionality.
